# Senior Project: Visualising Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning Models

This is the repository of the code for Sirakorn Lamyai's senior project. Although its original name intends to show the visualisation of adversarial models, the scope of the project has been changed to the process of investigating the transferability of adversarial perturbations across models' architectures, and the attack defencing techniques.

All the codes are entirely in the `codes` folder.

## Setting up the workspace

All the paths written in this project were relative to the main repository folder.
