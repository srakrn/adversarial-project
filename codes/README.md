# Codes

The codes are ordered as follows for the experiment

* **Base model training:** We initially train some fully connected neural network, convolution neural network, and state-of-the-art neural network (ResNet) to be attacked.
* **Train adversarial:** We calculate the perturbations of each testing points to be attacked by finding a set of input that would maximise the loss.
* **Adversarial exploration:** We observe the changes in model's performance after perturbations were added to the input.

Other folders are not used, and the codes are maintained only for historical/archival purpose.
